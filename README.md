# Minimal Armv8 cpu

Goal: 
- Create a minimal arm cpu based on armv8A ()
- Run program created by [this](https://github.com/1957-001B/ArmAsm) ()
- Learn how cpu works and DSP works using DSP slices for MUL on the cpu.
- Sythesize, program, and run the program on this [fpga](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-100t-artix-7-fpga-development-board/)
