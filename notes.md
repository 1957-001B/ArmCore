Goal: 
- Create a core that runs something in between armV7 and armv8 to work with this [assembler](https://www.github.com/1957-001B/armasm)
- Learn how cpu works and DSP works using DSP slices for MUL on the cpu.
- Sythesize, program, and run the program on [real hardware](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-100t-artix-7-fpga-development-board/)
